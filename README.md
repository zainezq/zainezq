# Hi there, I'm Zaine! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a final-year student at the University of Birmingham, majoring in computer science with a focus on web development, machine learning, and educational technology. I’m passionate about creating applications that make learning more accessible, especially for neurodiverse students.

## 🔭 Current Projects

- **Life long learning platform**: This is a place where students and teachers alike can access PDF's they upload, annotate literary texts, make notes, bookmarks etc., all for lifelong learning!

- **Full-Stack Football Finder App**: Collaborated as a team lead to build a platform that connects football players. The project used Angular/TypeScript for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, with PostgreSQL as the database.

## 🌱 Learning

- **Cloud Computing**: I'm exploring cloud solutions to improve my projects' scalability and reliability.
- **Advanced Networking**: Recently, I've been diving into switches, routers, and network configurations.
- **Java**: Currently upgrading my Java skills to take advantage of the latest features.
